Write a Java program containing two methods that will entangle and disentangle a string.

Take note of the template code in the code panel for the required method signatures and implement the logic in the "entangle" and "disentangle" methods.

Feel free to use the main method to test the methods.



Entangle strings


Input: Two strings of varying length.

Output: A single string containing all the characters from both input strings.



Notes:

The output string's even character positions (zero index) will be from the first string from left to right.
The output string's odd character positions (zero index) will be from the second string from right to left.
If either of the strings are longer, then the remaining characters must be appended to the result.


Example:

Input:

entangle("Hello", "World")  


Output:

HdellrlooW




Disentangle String


Input

inputString: A single string containing entangled strings.

largerStringLength: A positive/negative number indicating the number of characters in the larger string.

If negative - the larger string must be the first string in the output array.
If positive - the larger string must be the second string in the output array.


Output:

An array of strings after the input string has been disentangled, first index containing the left string and second index containing the right string.


Notes:

The output array at index 0 should contain all the characters in the input string's even character positions (zero index), up to the expected length for the first string.
The output array at index 1 should contain all the characters in the input string's odd character positions (zero index) in reverse order, up to the expected length for the second string.


Example:

Input:

inputString : "H!edlllrooW"
largerStringLength : 6
disentangle("H!edlllrooW", 6)


Output:

[ "Hello" , "World!"]
