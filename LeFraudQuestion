Could-a-Been Bank, 
a banking institution established on 1 June 2000, 
requires some of your skills to tackle a recent spike in fraudulent transaction attempts, 
the trend shows that a group of fraudulent account references have been created to invoke these 
fraudulent transactions, 
so you are required to create some form of validator to detect these false references.


The rules to passing validation are described as follows:

- date: 
    The first 6 characters specify a date (formatted as ddMMyyyy) that must be after the company's inception and cannot be in the future

- char sequence (a-z): 
    sequence of alphabetical characters (from a-z) of length 5

- length of the reference must be 13 characters long


An example of a valid reference would be: 21042023abcde
